Relax.
Everything is okay.
Don't panic.
The world is a beautiful place.
You have no enemies.
Your thoughts and beliefs are free. Think with impunity.
You don't have to care.
Rock and roll will never die.
Rap and hip-hop will never die.
Jazz will never die.
Sing a song. Sing out loud, sing out strong.
What a wonderful world.
Everything will be alright.
Loving yourself is not a sin.
Today is always the most enjoyable day.
Keep on swinging.
Unfurl the flag, luck just kissed you hello.
Bad days can be forgotten. Good days can be remembered.
It ain't no sin to be glad you're alive.
A group of teddy bears is called a "hug".
